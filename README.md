Robot that can read MIDI file and play it on a xylophone

Simply install a Python IDE (eg. Pycharm), Arduino IDE, and Processing IDE; run midi reader.py, ProjectArduino.ino, and ProjectSerial.pde in their respective IDEs.  Running the python file first should result in the creation of a data.txt output file which is then accessed in the Processing and Arduino IDEs.
